# Binary Heaps

## Objective
Implement binary heaps data structures in C++

## Tasks
1. Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it:

2. Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node.

4. Imagine you’ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?

99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2
